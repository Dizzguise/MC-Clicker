## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Hotkey not working?
- Try running as Administrator
- Ensure the hotkey isn't bound to another application
- Some systems require admin rights for global hotkeys

### Clicks not registering?
- Make sure the game/app window is focused
- Check the status indicator shows "RUNNING"
- Try adjusting the CPS value

### GUI looks small?
- This is intentional to keep the app lightweight
- Windows scales UI automatically
